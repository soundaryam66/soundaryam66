## Task 1 - Network Port Scanning

## Objective

To discover open ports in the local network and understand potential security risks.

## Tools Used

 * Nmap
 * Wireshark (optional)

## Steps

1.Installed Nmap.

2.Found my local IP range using if windows 'ipconfig' or else kali 'ifconfig'.

3.Open wireshark for capture the data packets.

4.Run nmap -sS '192.168.72.1/24'.

5.Saved results as 'scan_result.txt'.

6.Stop the wireshark and save the file 'capture.pcapng'.

7.Identified open ports and analyzed risks.

## Outcome

* Learned about TCP SYN scanning.
* Understood network exposure via open ports.
